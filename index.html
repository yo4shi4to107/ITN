      <p>Seize a move, you're on me, falling, and we were dissolving</p>
      <p>You and me, skies above and wide, it brings on the true night on me</p>
      <br><p>All I could feel was a "goodbye"</p>
      <p>Those only words you wrote, it's plenty to understand ya</p>
      <p>The sun is going down, the sky behind and visions of you would stand</p>
      <p>Overlapping with you and the fence beyond</p>
      <br><p>Remember the night that we met up</p>
      <p>Broke into me and taken everything left in my heart</p>
      <p>So fragile is that air, it always keeps on revolving near and wide</p>
      <p>Loneliness envelops deep in your eyes</p>
      <br><p>It's stuck in "tick-and-tocking" mode</p>
      <p>Never refraining shamble, block of sound</p>
      <p>Too many terrible noises around</p>
      <p>And the voice ringing in me gets louder</p>
      <p>With tears about to fall</p>
      <p>I need to find me an average happy tiptoe</p>
      <p>Locating, never tough when I'm with you</p>
      <br><p>Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights keep beating</p>
      <p>I'm going to you, and giving brighter shiny tomo orrows</p>
      <p>What can "night" for you mean, infinite? You could run with me</p>
      <p>Place your hand in mine, you gotta stay, hold up</p>
      <p>Want to leave it behind, dark cruel days, in deep, you may have hid before</p>
      <p>I'm embracing you until more heat dissolve what is caught up</p>
      <p>Sun will soon rise up into a day you're no more too afraid</p>
      <p>Keep all of me in you</p>
      <br><p>Only perceiving through your eyes</p>
      <p>I see nothing, I'll soon hate you, keep me out, I'm crying out</p>
      <p>You're falling into deeper fascination, giving away your love</p>
      <p>That expression has got me crying out</p>
      <br><p>She's gonna try to me, she's gonna lie</p>
      <p>Got to force a belief and trust to keep on</p>
      <p>Every time it happens, heap of attack, and now I'm back in</p>
      <p>I got to cry, then who knows?</p>
      <p>So we gotta keep on</p>
      <p>If you gotta keep on</p>
      <p>Then we're gonna keep on</p>
      <p>One day, we will understand, I'm believing in you</p>
      <br><p>"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking"</p>
      <p>As I show my needs, I reach to get back on, still not fit in</p>
      <p>You free my hand, then leave it</p>
      <p>"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking"</p>
      <p>Never told you the truth, I'm feeling that inside</p>
      <br><p>Back for another "tick-and-tocking" mode</p>
      <p>Never refraining shamble, block of sound</p>
      <p>Killing, oh, too many words that I gathered around</p>
      <p>Won't let me go to your mind</p>
      <p>"I want it to be done" is what went out</p>
      <p>It found a way to finally leak out of me</p>
      <p>And for once, I could make you let out a smile</p>
      <br><p>Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights are keeping me down</p>
      <p>My new images of you, now, appear heavenly now</p>
      <p>What can "night" for you mean when fallen seas of tears are gone</p>
      <p>They dissolve into the peace inside of you</p>
      <br><p>Calling to life, hit beneath, crying days in the eternal</p>
      <p>Give me what I saw in you, oh, what an end to stop all</p>
      <p>Seize a move, you're on me, falling and we were dissolving</p>
      <p>See me to it, fog is leaving, bright air move</p>
      <br><p>Want to leave it behind, tucked all days away, forget, and hid beneath</p>
      <p>Hand in hand, extend to me, that let me know beyond falls</p>
      <p>Through the seas of beyond, so loud and blows you afloat in the sky</p>
      <p>New wind moving into you</p>
      <p>Tonight, don't ever lose sight of me and let go</p>
      <p>You and me are running through the night in dark, I'll take you</p>
